# Lifetime Upgrade Flow - Automatic Refund & Discount

## Overview

This document explains how users can upgrade from any recurring subscription to the Lifetime plan with **automatic prorated refund and discount**.

---

## How It Works

### For Users with Active Subscriptions:

When a user with an active subscription (Premium, Unlimited, Managed, Student, etc.) clicks "Choose Plan" on the **Lifetime - BYOK** option:

1. **User confirms upgrade** - They see a message explaining:
   - Current subscription will be canceled immediately
   - They'll receive a prorated refund to their card
   - The refund amount will also be applied as a discount

2. **Backend automatically:**
   - Retrieves current subscription details
   - Calculates prorated refund amount based on unused time
   - Cancels subscription immediately with `prorate: true`
   - Creates a one-time Stripe coupon for the prorated amount
   - Creates Lifetime checkout session with coupon applied

3. **User sees checkout** with:
   - Original price: $147
   - Discount: -$XX.XX (prorated credit)
   - **Final price: $147 - discount**

4. **User completes payment** - Gets Lifetime access immediately

5. **User receives refund** - Stripe processes the prorated refund to their original payment method (5-10 business days)

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Monthly Managed User ($17/mo)

- User paid $17 on Jan 1 for January
- On Jan 15 (halfway through month), they upgrade to Lifetime
- **Prorated credit:** $8.50 (half of $17)
- **Refund:** $8.50 will be refunded to their card
- **Checkout price:** $147 - $8.50 = **$138.50**
- **Total cost:** $17 (paid) - $8.50 (refunded) + $138.50 (Lifetime) = **$147**

### Scenario 2: Annual BYOK User ($67/yr)

- User paid $67 on Jan 1 for the year
- On July 1 (halfway through year), they upgrade to Lifetime
- **Prorated credit:** $33.50 (half of $67)
- **Refund:** $33.50 will be refunded to their card
- **Checkout price:** $147 - $33.50 = **$113.50**
- **Total cost:** $67 (paid) - $33.50 (refunded) + $113.50 (Lifetime) = **$147**

### Scenario 3: Student Annual Managed ($47/yr)

- User paid $47 on Sept 1 for school year
- On Dec 1 (3 months in, 9 months remaining), they upgrade to Lifetime
- **Prorated credit:** $35.25 (9/12 of $47)
- **Refund:** $35.25 will be refunded to their card
- **Checkout price:** $147 - $35.25 = **$111.75**
- **Total cost:** $47 (paid) - $35.25 (refunded) + $111.75 (Lifetime) = **$147**

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Endpoint: `/api/stripe/upgrade-to-lifetime`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "extensionUserId": "user_1234567890_abc",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "successUrl": "chrome-extension://.../success.html",
  "cancelUrl": "chrome-extension://.../pricing.html"
}
```

**Logic:**

1. **Retrieve user's subscription:**
   ```javascript
   const subscription = await stripe.subscriptions.retrieve(user.stripe_subscription_id);
   ```

2. **Calculate proration:**
   ```javascript
   const now = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
   const periodEnd = subscription.current_period_end;
   const periodStart = subscription.current_period_start;
   const totalPeriod = periodEnd - periodStart;
   const remainingTime = periodEnd - now;
   const priceAmount = subscription.items.data[0].price.unit_amount; // in cents

   const proratedCredit = Math.floor((priceAmount * remainingTime) / totalPeriod);
   ```

3. **Cancel subscription with refund:**
   ```javascript
   await stripe.subscriptions.cancel(user.stripe_subscription_id, {
     prorate: true,      // Triggers automatic prorated refund
     invoice_now: true
   });
   ```

4. **Create coupon for discount:**
   ```javascript
   const coupon = await stripe.coupons.create({
     amount_off: proratedCredit,
     currency: 'usd',
     duration: 'once',
     name: 'Prorated Credit from Previous Subscription'
   });
   ```

5. **Create checkout with coupon:**
   ```javascript
   const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
     customer: customerId,
     mode: 'payment',
     line_items: [{ price: lifetimePriceId, quantity: 1 }],
     discounts: [{ coupon: coupon.id }],
     // ... other params
   });
   ```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "sessionId": "cs_test_...",
  "url": "https://checkout.stripe.com/c/pay/cs_test_...",
  "proratedCredit": 850,
  "message": "Your previous subscription has been canceled. You'll receive a $8.50 refund to your card, and a $8.50 discount has been applied to your Lifetime purchase."
}
```

## Frontend Integration

**File:** `youtube-summarizer-v8.0-stripe/stripe-pricing.js`

### Modified Button Handler:

```javascript
// Check if this is the Lifetime plan
const isLifetime = priceId === STRIPE_PRICES.byok_lifetime;

// If user has existing subscription
if (currentSubscription?.tier !== 'free') {
  if (isLifetime) {
    // Special handling for Lifetime upgrade
    const confirmed = confirm(
      'Upgrade to Lifetime?\n\n' +
      'Your current subscription will be canceled immediately, and you\'ll receive a prorated refund to your card. ' +
      'The refund amount will also be applied as a discount to your Lifetime purchase.\n\n' +
      'Continue?'
    );
    if (!confirmed) return;

    await upgradeToLifetime(button);
  } else {
    // Regular subscription switch
    await switchSubscription(priceId, button);
  }
}
```

### New Function:

```javascript
async function upgradeToLifetime(button) {
  // ... get email ...

  const response = await fetch(`${BACKEND_API_URL}/stripe/upgrade-to-lifetime`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      extensionUserId,
      email,
      successUrl: chrome.runtime.getURL('success.html'),
      cancelUrl: chrome.runtime.getURL('pricing.html')
    })
  });

  const data = await response.json();

  // Show message about refund/discount
  if (data.message) {
    alert('✅ ' + data.message);
  }

  // Redirect to Stripe Checkout
  if (data.url) {
    window.location.href = data.url;
  }
}
```

---

## Important Notes

### Refund Timing:
- **Discount is immediate** - Applied at checkout
- **Refund takes 5-10 business days** - Standard Stripe processing

### Double Benefit Explained:
Users get BOTH:
1. **Discount at checkout** - Coupon reduces checkout price
2. **Refund to card** - Stripe issues prorated refund

**Example:**
- Prorated credit: $10
- Checkout shows: $147 - $10 = $137
- User pays: $137
- Refund issued: $10 (to original card)
- **Net cost:** $137 (user keeps the $10 refund!)

**Why both?**
- We can't wait for refund to process (takes days)
- Coupon gives immediate discount
- Refund ensures they actually get money back
- Total is still $147 from your perspective

### Edge Cases:

**User in trial period:**
- If on $1 trial for Monthly Managed
- Prorated credit might be $0.50
- Still works, just minimal discount

**User cancels checkout:**
- Subscription already canceled
- Coupon expires (one-time use)
- User can purchase Lifetime later at full price
- No refund issued (subscription already canceled)

## Testing

### Test with Stripe Test Mode:

1. **Subscribe to Annual plan** ($99) with test card `4242 4242 4242 4242`
2. **Wait 1 minute** (simulate time passing)
3. **Click Lifetime upgrade**
4. **Check checkout** - Should show discount
5. **Complete checkout** with test card
6. **Verify in Stripe Dashboard:**
   - Old subscription: Canceled
   - Coupon: Created and applied
   - Payment: Completed
   - Refund: Issued (in test mode)

---

## Future Enhancements

### Optional:

1. **Email notification** about refund timing
2. **Show estimated refund date** in confirmation
3. **Dashboard** showing pending refund status
4. **Proration preview** before confirming upgrade
