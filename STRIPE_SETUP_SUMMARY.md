---

## 🎯 How It Works

### For Recurring Plans (8 products):

**Customer Portal Method:**
1. User subscribes via extension checkout
2. User clicks "Manage Subscription" → Stripe Customer Portal
3. User can:
   - Switch to any other recurring plan (prorated)
   - Update payment method
   - View invoices
   - Cancel subscription

**Direct API Method (also available):**
1. User can switch plans directly from extension
2. Backend calls `/change-subscription`
3. Proration applied automatically

### For Lifetime Plan:

**Special Upgrade Flow:**
1. User with active subscription clicks "Choose Lifetime"
2. Backend automatically:
   - Calculates prorated refund amount
   - Cancels current subscription
   - Issues refund to card
   - Creates checkout with discount coupon (equal to refund)
3. User pays net amount and gets Lifetime access
4. User receives refund in 5-10 business days

**Example:**
- User has Annual plan ($99/year), paid 6 months ago
- Upgrades to Lifetime
- **Prorated credit:** $49.50 (6 months unused)
- **Checkout shows:** $147 - $49.50 = $97.50
- **User pays:** $97.50
- **Refund issued:** $49.50 to card
- **Total Lifetime cost:** $49.50 (already paid) + $97.50 = $147 ✅
